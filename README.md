Code shared with Quora.
This is code shared as part of my answers to questions. Typically to verify mathematical derivations.

tangent.m takes as input the coordinates (p,q) of the external point and R, the radius of the circle. IT DOES NOT VERFY WHETHER p^2+q^2 \ge R^2. It assumes that.
It then proceeds to generate the tangent(s) and plots the same as a tangent*.png file. The outputfilename is hard coded.
